## Gameplay notes

This pakset is currently in "pre-alpha" state, meaning its not playable as a game for the moment. Many key features, such as economy, factories, many vehicles etc are yet to be added to the pakset before it makes sense as a playable game. However, it should compile and the things currently added should work as intended ingame.
Do note however, that any games saved with this pakset, might not be compatible with future releases!
